# Resolve the HuggingFace offline mode to start the stack with, and refuse to
# start a run that is guaranteed to stall.
#
# Background (ITEP-97604)
# -----------------------
# setup_models.sh does NOT pre-fetch the ASR/TTS/RAG models; they are pulled
# in-container on the first online run. On a host with no egress and no proxy,
# audio-analyzer and text-to-speech therefore raise httpx.ConnectError during
# FastAPI lifespan, their healthcheck never passes, and every service gated on
# `depends_on: service_healthy` aborts after the full 600s timeout. `make up`
# previously started anyway and simply stalled.
#
# Decision table (when HF_HUB_OFFLINE is not already 1):
#
#   egress reachable                 -> 0  (online, unchanged)
#   no egress + all caches populated -> 1  (auto offline; the stack can run)
#   no egress + caches cold          -> exit 3 (fail fast with remediation)
#
# HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 is always honoured untouched: forcing offline is a
# deliberate choice and this script never overrides it.
#
# Set HF_AUTO_OFFLINE=false to disable both the auto-switch and the fail-fast
# and restore the previous warn-and-continue behaviour.
#
# Writes the resolved value ("0" or "1") to stdout. All diagnostics go to
# stderr so the caller can safely do VALUE=$(resolve-hf-offline.sh).
#
# Set HF_RESOLVE_DRY_RUN=true to report the verdict without acting on it: the
# same probe runs, a human-readable summary goes to stderr, and the script
# always exits 0 (it never blocks). `check-env` uses this so there is exactly
# ONE probe implementation in the repo. An earlier inline copy of this logic
# in the Makefile drifted out of sync and contradicted this script -- see the
# comment on the `check-env` target.
#
# Exit codes: 0 resolved, 3 blocked (no egress, cold cache; never in dry run).

# Probe from inside a container, not the host: the host may have egress (or a
# proxy in the shell) that the containers do not.
#
# The probe tool matters more than the probe image. huggingface.co sits behind
# an edge that rejects busybox wget with "403 Forbidden" even when the network
# path is perfectly fine -- verified on a host where busybox wget got 403 and
# curl got 200 through the SAME proxy, with and without it. Treating that 403
# as "no egress" forces HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 on a perfectly online host, and that
# breaks startup: `optimum-cli export openvino` has to reach the Hub API to
# infer a model's task, so a first-run IR export fails offline even when the
# source weights are cached.
#
# So: prefer an image that has curl, and never let a wget 403 alone mean
# "unreachable". The stack's own images carry curl and are the most faithful
# probe available -- same base, same TLS stack, same network as the real
# workload -- so they come first; alpine/busybox are a last resort.
#
# Pick by CAPABILITY, not by name: some service images ship neither curl nor
# wget (audio-analyzer is one), so probing with them silently fails with
# "wget: not found" and looks exactly like no egress. Ask each candidate what
# it actually has, prefer curl, and remember which tool was found.
